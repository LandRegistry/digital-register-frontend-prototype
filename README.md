# GOV.UK Prototyping Kit

The kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

It's built on the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework, and uses these GOV.UK resources:

- [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template)
- [GOV.UK front end toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit)
- [GOV.UK elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements)

## Requirements

#### [Node](http://nodejs.org/)

You may already have it, try:

```
node --version
```

Your version needs to be at least v0.10.0.

If you don't have Node, download it here: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

## Getting started

Install Node.js (see requirements)

#### Clone this repo

```
git clone git@github.com:LandRegistry/digital-register-frontend-prototype.git
```

#### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

This will install folders containing programs described by the package.json file to a folder called `node_modules`.

#### Run the app

```
node start.js
```

Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

#### Hot reload

Any code changes should update in the browser without you restarting the app.

The app recompiles app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss everytime changes are observed.
